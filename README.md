## RL Team Maker

This web app helps Rocket League tournament directors to quickly pull player data from the RL Tracker site, make teams, and (eventually) generate tournament brackets.

The project board for this app is on [notion](https://www.notion.so/halshin/RL-Team-Maker-659fd2facbc34b799eb6112c95e63d86).
